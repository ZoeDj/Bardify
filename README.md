This is a page that mixes modern lyricism with old.

We take input from the user in the form of an artist and song, and run it through an api that generates the lyrics the the given song. 
After, we run that return through another api that will translate the lyrics to Shakespearean English, and then display them to the user. 
For added entertainment, and a bit of a hook, we run the translated lyrics through another api that preforms text to speech--
in hopes to give you a funny sounding version of the song you chose. 

We also have a raondom button in place, in case the user just wants to try out the functionality without coming up with their own
suggestion. It will pull a song we have tested, that way there is no frustration of not being able to find the lyrics in the api we are
using. 

The user will have the abilty to like the finished product, those likes are tracked, and will dynamically generate the trending section at
the bottom of the page.
